### Define the following: 

Denial of Service: Any attack intended to compromise the availability of networks and systems. This includes both network and application attacks designed to overwhelm systems, resulting in performance degradation or interruption of service.

Command and Control: Command and Control Infrastructure, also known as C2 or C&C, is a set of tools and techniques that attackers use to maintain communication with compromised devices following initial exploitation.
